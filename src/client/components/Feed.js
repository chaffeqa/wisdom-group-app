                The Abandoned Ship is a wrecked ship located on Route 108 in
                Hoenn, originally being a ship named the S.S. Cactus. The second
                part of the ship can only be accessed by using Dive and contains

                Dotted around the Hoenn region, you will find loamy soil, many
                of which are housing berries. Once you have picked the berries,
                then you have the ability to use that loamy soil to grow your
                own berries. These can be any berry and will require attention
                to get the best crop.
